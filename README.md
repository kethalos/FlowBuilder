Flow Builder


Flow Builder is a simple, customizable, and mindful productivity timer designed to help users gradually enter and maintain a state of deep concentration or flow. Inspired by the progressive Pomodoro technique and Buddhist simplicity, it helps users self-reflect on their work sessions and adapt their focus periods over time.


Features
Customizable Timers – Start each session with configurable work and break durations (default: 5 mins each).
Daily Goal Tracking – Set a session target in hours and minutes (default: 8 hours) and track your progress visually.
Progressive Focus Cycles – Timer duration adapts based on self-rated focus from the last session:
	1: Distracted → shorter next session
	2: Okay → same length
	3: Focused → longer session
	4: Flow → longest session (up to 25 minutes)

Auditory Alerts – Three beeps signal the end of each timer period. Plan to make that a basu bell sound eventually.
Visual Cues – Clear color cues for work (green) and rest (blue) states.
Mindful Interface – Built to encourage self-reflection and conscious pacing of deep work.


Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Windows OS (uses winsound)


How It Works
Start by configuring your session: work time, break time, and total daily goal.

Hit Start Work Timer to begin your first session.

After each work session, you’re prompted to continue or take a break.

If you choose to take a break, you’ll rate the session and optionally modify the recommended timer.

Your progress toward the goal is tracked with each completed work session.

Inspiration
This tool was inspired by Buddhist practice, Pomodoro techniques, and the concept of entering a flow state through incremental focus cycles. May it support your calm, clear, and concentrated work.
